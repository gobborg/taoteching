Assists and does not contend
The Tao of sages
Benefits and does not harm
The Tao of heaven
The more they give to others, the more they gain
The more they assist others, the more they possess
Sages do not accumulate
Those who are broad of knowledge do not know
Those who know are not broad of knowledge
Those who debate are not good
Those who are good do not debate
Beautiful words are not true
True words are not beautiful
Do not go back and forth with one another
The people, until they grow old and die
Hear the sounds of roosters and dogs from one another
Neighboring countries see one another
Content in their homes, happy in their customs
Savor their food, admire their clothes
Let the people return to tying knots and using them
They have no need to display them
Although they have armors and weapons
They have no need to take them
Although they have boats and chariots
And not migrate far away
Let the people regard death seriously
But not use them
Let them have many weapons
Small country, few people
It constantly gives to the kind people
The Heavenly Tao has no favorites
Those without virtue hold the collections
Those who have virtue hold the contract
But does not demand payment from the other person
the left part of the contract
Therefore the sage holds
How can this be considered good?
There must be remaining resentments
After settling a great dispute
The truth seems like the opposite
Becomes king of the world
The one who accepts the misfortune of the state
Is called its master
The one who accepts the humiliation of the state
Therefore sages say:
But cannot put into practice
Everybody in the world knows
And the soft overcomes the hard
That the weak overcomes the strong
This is because nothing can replace it
Yet nothing is better at overcoming the hard and strong
Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water
They do not wish to display their virtue!
Achieve without claiming credit
Therefore sages act without conceit
Only those who have the Tao
Who can offer their excess to the world?
In order to offer to the excessive
It reduces the lacking
The Tao of people is not so
And adds to the lacking
Reduces the excessive
The Tao of heaven
Add to that which is lacking
Reduce that which has excess
Raise that which is low
Lower that which is high
Is like drawing a bow
The Tao of Heaven
While the soft and pliant occupy a higher place
The big and forceful occupy a lowly position
A strong tree will be cut down
Therefore, an inflexible army will not win
is the follower of life
That which is soft and yielding
is the follower of death
Thus that which is hard and stiff
When dead, become dry and brittle
While alive, are soft and supple
All living things, grass and trees,
When dead, it is hard and rigid
While alive, the body is soft and pliant
Are better than those who value living
Therefore those who do not strive for living
So they disregard death
Is due to the glut in their ruler's pursuit of life
The people's disregard for death
So they are difficult to govern
Is due to the meddling of their ruler
The people's difficulty in being governed
So they starve
Is due to the excess of their ruler's taxation
The people's hunger
It is rare that they do not hurt their own hands
Those who substitute for the great carpenter to cut
It is like substituting for the great carpenter to cut
If we substitute for the master executioner to kill
There exists a master executioner that kills
Who would dare?
I can capture and kill them
Then those who act unlawfully
If people are made to constantly fear death
How can they be threatened with death?
People do not fear death
Loose, and yet does not let anything slip through
The heavenly net is vast
Is unhurried and yet excels in planning
Is not summoned and yet comes on its own
Does not speak and yet excels in responding
Does not contend and yet excels in winning
The Tao of Heaven:
Even the sages still find this difficult
The one hated by Heaven â€“ who knows the reason?
Of these two, one may benefit, the other may harm
The bold in not daring will survive
The bold in daring will be killed
Thus they discard that and take this
Respect themselves but do not praise themselves
Know themselves but do not glorify themselves
Therefore the sages:
Therefore they do not reject the ruler
Because the ruler does not reject them
Do not reject their livelihood
Do not limit their place
They bring about greater force
When people no longer fear force
That is why they are without fault
Because they recognize the fault as a fault
The sages are without fault
can one be without fault
Only when one recognizes the fault as a fault
To not know but think you know is flawed
To know that you do not know is highest
Therefore the sage wears plain clothes but holds jade
Thus I am highly valued
Those who understand me are few
Therefore they do not understand me
People do not understand this
My actions have principle
My words have basis
The world cannot understand, cannot practice
My words are easy to understand, easy to practice
The side that is compassionate shall win
So when evenly matched armies meet
Underestimating the enemy almost made me lose my treasures
There is no greater disaster than to underestimate the enemy
Holding weapons without weapons
Grappling enemies without enemies
Raising arms without arms
Marching in formation without formation
This is called:
I dare not advance an inch, but prefer to withdraw a foot
I dare not be the host, but prefer to be the guest
In using the military, there is a saying:
The ultimate principle of the ancients
It is called being harmonious with Heaven
It is called the power of managing people
the virtue of non-contention
It is called
Those who are good at managing people lower themselves
Those who are good at defeating enemies do not engage them
The great warriors do not get angry
The great generals are not warlike
And with compassion guard them
Heaven shall save them
With defense, then security
If one fights with compassion, then victory
Then death!
Goes ahead but discards being behind
Reaches widely but discards conservation
but discards compassion
Now if one has courage
Thus able to assume leadership
Not daring to be ahead in the world
Conserving, thus able to reach widely
Compassionate, thus able to have courage
The third is called not daring to be ahead in the world
The second is called conservation
The first is called compassion
I hold on to them and protect them
I have three treasures
It would already be insignificant long ago!
If it can be compared
That it seems beyond compare
It is only because of its greatness
As if it is beyond compare
Everyone in the world calls my Tao great
So the world cannot contend with them
Because they do not contend
Thus the world is glad to push them forward without resentment
But the people do not feel harmed
They are positioned in front
But the people do not feel burdened
Thus the sages are positioned above
They must place themselves behind them
If they wish to be in front of people
They must speak humbly to them
Thus if sages wish to be over people
So they can be the kings of a hundred valleys
Because of their goodness in staying low
Rivers and oceans can be the kings of a hundred valleys
Then it reaches great congruence
It goes opposite to material things
Mystic Virtue: Profound! Far-reaching!
Is called Mystic Virtue
Always knowing these standards
Know that these two are both standards
Is being a blessing of the state
Not using cleverness to govern the state
Is being a thief of the state
Therefore, using cleverness to govern the state
Is due their excessive cleverness
The difficulty in governing people
But to keep them simple
Used it not to make people brighter
Those of ancient times who were adept at the Tao
Without daring to meddle
To assist the nature of all things
and redeem the fault of the people
They learn to unlearn
and do not value goods that are hard to acquire
Therefore, sages desire not to desire
Then they would have no failure
If they are as careful in the end as the beginning
Often come close to completion and fail
People, in handling affairs
Do not grasp and thus do not lose
Do not meddle and thus do not fail
Therefore, sages:
The one who grasps will lose
The one who meddles will fail
Begins beneath the feet
A journey of a thousand miles
Starts from the dirt heap
A tower of nine levels
Grows from the tiny sapling
A tree thick enough to embrace
Treat it when it is not yet chaotic
Act on it when it has not yet begun
When it is small, it is easy to scatter
When it is fragile, it is easy to break
When it shows no signs, it is easy to plan
When it is peaceful, it is easy to maintain
So they never encounter difficulties all through life
Therefore, sages regard things as difficult
One who sees many easy tasks must encounter much difficulty
One who makes promises lightly must deserve little trust
Thus they can achieve greatness
Therefore, sages never attempt great deeds all through life
Must be handled through the small tasks
The large tasks of the world
Must be handled through the simple tasks
The difficult tasks of the world
Achieve large tasks through the smallest tasks
Plan difficult tasks through the simplest tasks
Respond to hatred with virtue
Great, small, many, few
Taste without tasting
Manage without meddling
Act without action
Therefore, it is the greatest value in the world
And those with guilt will not be faulted?
Is it not said that those who seek will find,
Why did the ancients value this Tao so much?
None of it can compare to being seated in this Tao
Although there is the offering of jade before four horses
And installing the three ministers
Therefore, when crowning the Emperor
How can they be abandoned?
Those who are unkind
Admirable actions can improve people
Admirable words can win the public's respect
The protection of the unkind person
The treasure of the kind person
The Tao is the wonder of all things
The larger one should assume the lower position
So that both obtain what they wish
The small country only wishes to join and serve people
The large country only wishes to gather and protect people
The other uses the lower position to be taken
Thus one uses the lower position to take
Then it can be taken by the large country
If the small country is lower than the large country
Then it can take the small country
Thus if the large country is lower than the small country
Using serenity as the lower position
The female always overcomes the male with serenity
The receptive female of the world
The converging point of the world
The large country is like the lowest river
So virtue merges and returns
They both do no harm to one another
The sages also do not harm people
Not only do its gods not harm people
Its gods do not harm people
Not only do its demons have no power
Its demons have no power
Using the Tao to manage the world
Ruling a large country is like cooking a small fish
The Tao of longevity and lasting vision
This is called deep roots and firm foundation
With this mother principle of power, one can be everlasting
The limitations being unknown, one can possess sovereignty
One's limits are unknown
When there is nothing that one cannot overcome
Accumulating virtues means there is nothing one cannot overcome
Submitting early is called emphasis on accumulating virtues
Only with conservation is it called submitting early
There is nothing like conservation
In governing people and serving Heaven
Illuminated without being flashy
Straightforward without being ruthless
Incorruptible without being piercing
Righteous without being scathing
Therefore the sages are:
has lasted many long days
The confusion of people
Goodness reverts to become wicked
Rightness reverts to become strange
Or if they have no determined outcome?
Who knows their ultimate end
Fortune is where misfortune hides beneath
Misfortune is what fortune depends upon
The people are shrewd and crafty
When governing is scrutinizing
The people are simple and honest
When governing is lackluster
I have no desires, and the people simplify themselves
I do not interfere, and the people enrich themselves
I prefer quiet, and the people right themselves
I take unattached action, and the people transform themselves
Therefore the sage says:
The more robbers and thieves there are
The more laws are posted
More strange things occur
When people have many clever tricks
The country becomes more chaotic
When people have many sharp weapons
The people become more impoverished
When there are many restrictions in the world
With the following:
How do I know this is so?
Take the world with non-interference
Deploy the military with surprise tactics
Govern a country with upright integrity
Therefore, they become honored by the world
They cannot obtain this and be degraded
They cannot obtain this and be valued
They cannot obtain this and be harmed
They cannot obtain this and be benefited
They cannot obtain this and be distant
They cannot obtain this and be closer
This is called Mystic Oneness
Mix the dust
Dim the glare
Unravel the knots
Blunt the sharpness
Shut the doors
Close the mouth
Those who talk do not know
Those who know do not talk
That which is contrary to the Tao will soon perish
This is called contrary to the Tao
Things become strong and then grow old
Mind overusing energy is said to be aggressive
Excessive vitality is said to be inauspicious
Knowing constancy is said to be clarity
Knowing harmony is said to be constancy
Due to the optimum of harmony
They can cry the whole day and yet not be hoarse
Due to the optimum of essence
They do not know of sexual union but can manifest arousal
But their grasp is firm
Their bones are weak, tendons are soft
Birds of prey do not attack them
Wild beasts do not claw them
Poisonous insects do not sting them
Are similar to newborn infants
Those who hold an abundance of virtue
With this
With what do I know the world?
Observe the world with the world
Observe other countries with your country
Observe other communities with your community
Observe other families with your family
Observe others with yourself
Therefore:
Cultivate it in the world; its virtue shall be widespread
Cultivate it in the country; its virtue shall be prosperous
Cultivate it in the community; its virtue shall be lasting
Cultivate it in the family; its virtue shall be abundant
Cultivate it in yourself; its virtue shall be true
The descendants will commemorate it forever
That which is strongly held cannot be taken
That which is well established cannot be uprooted
It is not the Tao
This is called robbery
Acquire excessive wealth
Fill up on drinks and food
Carry sharp swords
Officials wear fineries
The warehouses are empty
The fields are barren
The courts are corrupt
But people like the side paths
The great Tao is broad and plain
I fear only to deviate from it
Walking on the great Tao
If I have a little knowledge
This is called practicing constancy
Leaving no disasters for the self
Return to the clarity
Utilize the light
Holding on to the soft is called strength
Seeing details is called clarity
Live without salvation all through life
Meddle in the affairs
Open the mouth
Live without toil all through life
Shut the doors
Close the mouth
Live without danger all through life
Still holding on to the mother
Knowing her children
We can know her children
Having its mother
We regard it as the mother of the world
The world has a beginning
This is called Mystic Virtue
Nurtures but does not dominate
Acts but does not flaunt
Produces but does not possess
Nurtures them, protects them
Perfects them, matures them
Grows them, educates them
Virtue raises them
Thus Tao produces them
but to constant nature
Not due to command
The respect for Tao, the value of virtue
all respect the Tao and value virtue
Therefore the myriad things 
Forces perfect them
Things shape them
Virtue raises them
Tao produces them
Because they have no place for death
Why?
Soldiers have nowhere to lodge their blades
Tigers have nowhere to clasp their claws
Rhinos have nowhere to thrust their horns
Entering into an army, they are not harmed by weapons
Traveling on the road, they do not encounter rhinos or tigers
I've heard of those who are good at cultivating life
Because they live lives of excess
Why?
Also three in ten
Those whose lives are moved toward death
The followers of death, three in ten
The followers of life, three in ten
Coming into life, entering death
The sages care for them as children
The people all pay attention with their ears and eyes
They cautiously merge their mind for the world
The sages live in the world
Thus the virtue of belief
Those who do not believe, I also believe them
Those who believe, I believe them
Thus the virtue of goodness
Those who are not good, I am also good to them
Those who are good, I am good to them
They take the mind of the people as their mind
The sages have no constant mind
is not qualified to take the world
The one who interferes 
Take the world by constantly applying non-interference
With unattached action, there is nothing one cannot do
Until one reaches unattached action
Loss and more loss
Pursue Tao, daily loss
Pursue knowledge, daily gain
Achieves without striving
Names without seeing
Knows without going
Therefore the sage
The less one knows
The further one goes
Without peering out the window, see the Heavenly Tao
Without going out the door, know the world
is the lasting satisfaction
Thus the satisfaction of contentment
No fault greater than avarice
No disaster greater than discontentment
There is no crime greater than greed
Warhorses give birth on the battlefield
When the world lacks the Tao
Fast horses are retired to till the soil
When the world has the Tao
Clear quietness is the standard of the world
Stillness overcomes heat
Movement overcomes cold
Great eloquence seems inarticulate
Great skill seems unrefined
Great straightness seems bent
Its function is without exhaustion
Great fullness seems empty
Its function is without failure
Great perfection seems flawed
Thus one can endure indefinitely
Knowing when to stop avoids danger
Knowing contentment avoids disgrace
Excessive hoarding must lead to heavy loss
Thus excessive love must lead to great spending
Gain or loss, which is more painful?
The self or wealth, which is greater?
Fame or the self, which is dearer?
Are rarely matched in the world
The benefits of actions without attachment
The teaching without words
From this I know the benefits of unattached actions
Enters into that which has no openings
That which has no substance
Override the hardest things of the world
The softest things of the world
I will use this as the principal of all teachings
The violent one cannot have a natural death
I will also teach
What the ancients taught
Or receive benefit but lose
Appear to take loss but benefit
So with all things
But the rulers call themselves with these terms
Are alone, bereft, and unworthy
What the people dislike
Achieve harmony by integrating their energy
Myriad things, backed by yin and embracing yang
Three produce myriad things
Two produce three
One produces two
Tao produces one
That excels in giving and completing everything
Yet it is only the Tao
The Tao is hidden and nameless
The great image has no form
The great music is imperceptible in sound
The great vessel is late in completion
The great square has no corners
True substance appears inconstant
Building virtue appears inactive
Encompassing virtue appears insufficient
Great integrity appears like disgrace
High virtue appears like a valley
The smooth Tao appears uneven
The advancing Tao appears to retreat
The clear Tao appears unclear
Therefore a proverb has the following:
If they do not laugh, it would not be the Tao
They laugh loudly at it
Lower people hear of the Tao
They sometimes keep it and sometimes lose it
Average people hear of the Tao
They diligently practice it
Higher people hear of the Tao
Being is born of non-being
The myriad things of the world are born of being
The weak is the utilization of the Tao
The returning is the movement of the Tao
Be dull like rocks
Do not wish to be shiny like jade
Therefore, the ultimate honor is no honor
Is this not using the lowly as basis? Is it not so?
Thus the rulers call themselves alone, bereft, and unworthy
The higher uses the lower as foundation
Therefore, the honored uses the lowly as basis
The rulers, lacking lofty standards, would be toppled
Myriad things, lacking life, would be extinct
The valley, lacking abundance, would wither
The gods, lacking divinity, would vanish
The earth, lacking tranquility, would erupt
The sky, lacking clarity, would break apart
These all emerged from oneness
The rulers attained oneness and became the worldâ€™s standard
The myriad things attained oneness and thus life
The valley attained oneness and thus abundance
The gods attained oneness and thus divinity
The earth attained oneness and thus tranquility
The sky attained oneness and thus clarity
Those that attained oneness since ancient times:
Thus they discard that and take this
Abides in the real, and does not dwell on the flower
Abides in substance, and does not dwell on the thin shell
Therefore the great person:
And the beginning of ignorance
Are the flowers of the Tao
Those with foreknowledge
And the beginning of chaos
Those who have etiquette are a thin shell of loyalty and sincerity
Righteousness is lost, and then etiquette
Benevolence is lost, and then righteousness
Virtue is lost, and then benevolence
Therefore, the Tao is lost, and then virtue
Uses arms to pull others
And upon encountering no response
High etiquette takes contrived action
And acts with agenda
High righteousness takes contrived action
And acts without agenda
High benevolence takes contrived action
And acts with agenda
Low virtue takes contrived action
And acts without agenda
High virtue takes no contrived action
Therefore it has no virtue
Low virtue never loses virtue
Therefore it has virtue
High virtue is not virtuous
The world shall steady itself
Without desire, using stillness
They shall be without desire
The simplicity of the nameless
I shall restrain them with the simplicity of the nameless
Transformed, yet wishing to achieve
All things shall transform themselves
If the sovereign can hold on to this
Yet there is nothing it does not do
The Tao is constant in non-action
Cannot be shown to the people
The sharp instruments of the state
Fish cannot leave the depths
The soft and weak overcomes the tough and strong
This is called subtle clarity
One must first give it
If one wishes to seize it
One must first promote it
If one wishes to discard it
One must first strengthen it
If one wishes to weaken it
One must first expand it
If one wishes to shrink it
Use it, it cannot be exhausted
Listen to it, it cannot be heard
Look at it, it cannot be seen
Is bland and without flavor
The Tao that is spoken out of the mouth
Music and food, passing travelers stop
They come without harm, in harmonious peace
All under heaven will come
Hold the great image
That is how it can achieve its greatness
Even in the end, it does not regard itself as great
It can be named great
Myriad things return to it but it does not rule over them
It can be named insignificant
Ever desiring nothing
It clothes and feeds myriad things, but does not rule over them
It achieves its work, but does not take credit
The myriad things depend on it for life, but it never stops
It can flow to the left or to the right
The great Tao is like a flood
Those who die but do not perish have longevity
Those who do not lose their base endure
Those who proceed vigorously have willpower
Those who know contentment are wealthy
Those who overcome themselves are powerful
Those who overcome others have strength
Those who understand themselves are enlightened
Those who understand others are intelligent
Is like streams in the valley into rivers and the ocean
The existence of the Tao in the world
Knowing when to stop, thus avoiding danger
One should know when to stop
Names came to exist everywhere
In the beginning, there were names
People will not need to force it; it will adjust by itself
Will rain sweet dew
Heaven and Earth, together in harmony
All will follow by themselves
If the sovereign can hold on to it
Cannot be treated by the world as subservient
Its simplicity, although imperceptible
The Tao, eternally nameless
Victory in war should be treated as a funeral
Should be mourned with sadness
Those who have been killed
We say that they are treated as if in a funeral
The major general is positioned to the right
The lieutenant general is positioned to the left
Inauspicious events favor the right
Auspicious events favor the left
Cannot achieve their ambitions upon the world
Those who delight in killing
Are delighting in the killing
Those who glorify
Victorious but without glory
Calm detachment should be above all
When using it out of necessity
Not the tool of honorable gentlemen
The military is a tool of misfortune
When deploying the military, value the right
Honorable gentlemen, while at home, value the left
Therefore, those who possess the Tao avoid it
All things detest it
A strong military, a tool of misfortune
That which is contrary to the Tao soon ends
This is called contrary to the Tao
Things become strong and then get old
Achieves result but does not dominate
Achieves result but only out of necessity
Achieves result but is not arrogant
Achieves result but does not flaunt
Achieves result but does not brag
And does not dare to reach for domination
A good commander achieves result, then stops
There must be an inauspicious year
Following the great army
Thistles and thorns grow
The place where the troops camp
Such methods tend to be returned
Does not dominate the world with soldiers
The one who uses the Tao to advise the ruler
Eliminates arrogance
Eliminates excess
Eliminates extremes
Therefore the sage:
Either have ownership or take by force
Either have strength or weakness
Either blow hot or cold
Either lead or follow
Thus all things:
The one who grasps it will lose
The one who controls it will fail
One cannot control it
The world is a sacred instrument
I see that they cannot succeed
Those who wish to take the world and control it
Thus the greater whole is undivided
And then become leaders
The sages utilize them
Plain wood splits, then becomes tools
Return to the state of plain wood
The eternal virtue shall be sufficient
Being the valley of the world
Be the valley of the world
Know the honor, hold to the humility
Return to the state of the boundless
The eternal virtue does not deviate
Being the standard of the world
Be the standard of the world
Know the white, hold to the black
Return to the state of the infant
The eternal virtue does not depart
Being the watercourse of the world
Be the watercourse of the world
Know the masculine, hold to the feminine
This is called the essential wonder
Although intelligent, they are greatly confused
And do not love their resources
Those who do not value their teachers
The bad person is the resource of the good person
Therefore the good person is the teacher of the bad person
This is called following enlightenment
and so do not abandon anything
They often save things
and so do not abandon anyone
Often save others
Therefore sages:
Good knot needs no rope and yet cannot be untied
Good closure needs no bar and yet cannot be opened
Good reckoning does not use counters
Good speech does not seek faults
Good traveling does not leave tracks
To be restless is to lose one's mastery
To be light is to lose one's root
Apply themselves lightly to the world?
How can the lords of ten thousand chariots
They are composed and transcend beyond
Even though there are luxurious sights
Without leaving the heavy supplies
Therefore the sages travel an entire day
Quietness is the master of restlessness
Heaviness is the root of lightness
Tao follows the laws of nature
Heaven follows the laws of Tao
Earth follows the laws of Heaven
Humans follow the laws of Earth
And the sovereign occupies one of them
There are four greats in the universe
The sovereign is also great
Earth is great
Heaven is great
Therefore the Tao is great
Receding means returning
Passing means receding
Great means passing
Forced to describe it, I call it great
To identify it, I call it "Tao"
I do not know its name
It can be regarded as the mother of the world
Circulating and ceaseless
Independent and changeless
So silent! So ethereal!
Born before Heaven and Earth
There is something formlessly created
Thus, those who possesses the Tao do not engage in them
They despise them
Those with the Tao call such things leftover food or tumors
Those who boast about themselves do not last
Those who praise themselves have no merit
Those who presume themselves are not distinguished
Those who flaunt themselves are not clear
Those who straddle cannot walk
Those who are on tiptoes cannot stand
Those who do not trust sufficiently, others have no trust in them
loss is also please to have them
Those who are with loss
virtue is also pleased to have them
Those who are with virtue
the Tao is also pleased to have them
Those who are with the Tao
Those of loss are with loss
Those of virtue are with virtue
Those of the Tao are with the Tao
Thus for those who follow the Tao:
How can humans?
Even Heaven and Earth cannot make it last
What makes this so? Heaven and Earth
Sudden rain does not last all day
Thus strong wind does not last all morning
Sparse speech is natural
Sincerity becoming whole, and returning to oneself
Were they speaking empty words?
What the ancients called "the one who yields and remains whole"
the world cannot contend with them
Because they do not contend
Without boasting about themselves â€“ and so are lasting
Without praising themselves â€“ and so have merit
Without presuming themselves â€“ and so are distinguished
Without flaunting themselves â€“ and so are seen clearly
as an example for the world
Therefore the sages hold to the one
Have much and be confused
Have little and receive
Be worn out and become renewed
Be low and become filled
Bend and remain straight
Yield and remain whole
With this
How do I know the nature of the source?
To observe the source of all things
Its name never departs
From ancient times to the present
Within it there is faith
Its essence is supremely real
Within it there is essence
So deep, so profound
Within it there is substance
So indistinct, so unclear
Within it there is image
So unclear, so indistinct
Seems indistinct, seems unclear
The Tao, as a thing
Follows only the Tao
The appearance of great virtue
And value the nourishing mother
I alone am different from them
And I alone am stubborn and lowly
The people all have goals
Such high wind, as if without limits
Such tranquility, like the ocean
I alone am obtuse
Ordinary people are scrutinizing
I alone am muddled
Ordinary people are bright
I have the heart of a fool indeed â€“ so ignorant!
While I alone seem lacking
The people all have surplus
So weary, like having no place to return
Like an infant not yet smiling
I alone am quiet and uninvolved
As if climbing up to the terrace in spring
As if enjoying a great feast
The people are excited
So desolate! How limitless it is!
What the people fear, I cannot be unafraid
How much do they differ?
Goodness and evil
How much is the difference?
Respectful response and scornful response
Cease learning, no more worries
Reduce selfishness; decrease desires
Show plainness; hold simplicity
Thus this teaching has its place:
These three things are superficial and insufficient
Bandits and thieves no longer exist
End cunning; discard profit
The people return to piety and charity
End benevolence; abandon righteousness
The people benefit a hundred times
End sagacity; abandon knowledge
There are loyal ministers
The country is in confused chaos
There is filial piety and kind affection
The six relations are not harmonious
There is great deception
Intelligence comes forth
There is benevolence and justice
The great Tao fades away
The people all say, "We did it naturally"
Task accomplished, matter settled
Proceeding calmly, valuing their words
Have no trust in them
If the rulers' trust is insufficient
The next level, people despise them
The next level, people fear them
The next level, people love them and praise them
The highest rulers, people do not know they have them
The self is no more, without danger
Tao is eternal
Heaven is Tao
Sovereign is Heaven
Impartiality is sovereign
Acceptance is impartiality
Knowing constancy is acceptance
Not knowing constancy, one recklessly causes trouble
Knowing constancy is called clarity
Returning to one's nature is called constancy
Tranquility is called returning to one's nature
Returning to the root is called tranquility
Everything flourishes; each returns to its root
I therefore watch their return
The myriad things are all active
Hold on to the truest tranquility
Attain the ultimate emptiness
Therefore one can preserve and not create anew
Because one is not overfilled
One who holds this Tao does not wish to be overfilled
In motion gradually come alive?
Who can be serene yet persist
In stillness gradually become clear?
Who can be muddled yet desist
Opaque, like muddy water
Open, like a valley
Genuine, like plain wood
Loose, like ice about to melt
Solemn, like a guest
Cautious, like fearing four neighbors
Hesitant, like crossing a wintry river
Therefore one is forced to describe the appearance
Because one cannot discern them
Depths that cannot be discerned
Subtle wonders through mystery
The Tao masters of antiquity
It is called the Tao Axiom
One can know the ancient beginning
To manage the existence of today
Wield the Tao of the ancients
Follow it, its back cannot be seen
Confront it, its front cannot be seen
This is called enigmatic
The image of the imageless
Thus it is called the form of the formless
It returns back into nothingness
Continuing endlessly, cannot be named
Below it, not dark
Above it, not bright
So they are combined into one
These three cannot be completely unraveled
It is called formless
Reach for it, it cannot be held
It is called noiseless
Listen to it, it cannot be heard
It is called colorless
Look at it, it cannot be seen
Can be entrusted with the world
One who loves the self as the world
Can be given the world
So one who values the self as the world
What misfortune do I have?
If I have no self
Is that I have the self
The reason I have great misfortune
What does "the greatest misfortune is the self" mean?
This is "favor and disgrace make one fearful"
Losing it makes one fearful
Having it makes one fearful
Favor is high; disgrace is low
What does "favor and disgrace make one fearful" mean?
The greatest misfortune is the self
Favor and disgrace make one fearful
That is why they discard the other and take this
Therefore the sages care for the stomach and not the eyes
Goods that are difficult to acquire make one cause damage
Racing and hunting make one wild in the heart
The five flavors make one tasteless in the mouth
The five sounds make one deaf in the ears
The five colors make one blind in the eyes
That which is empty is used to create functionality
Therefore, that which exists is used to create benefit
In its emptiness, there is the function of a room
Cut open doors and windows to create a room
In its emptiness, there is the function of a container
Mix clay to create a container
In its emptiness, there is the function of a vehicle
Thirty spokes join in one hub
This is called the Mystic Virtue
Raising without domination
Achieving without arrogance
Bearing without possession
Bearing it, rearing it
Can one be without intellectuality?
In understanding clearly all directions
Can one hold to the feminine principle?
In the heavenly gate's opening and closing
Can one be without manipulation?
In loving the people and ruling the nation
Can one be without imperfections?
In cleaning away the worldly view
Can one be like an infant?
In concentrating the energy and reaching relaxation
Can one be steadfast, without straying?
In holding the soul and embracing oneness
This is the Tao of Heaven
Withdraw oneself
When achievement is completed, fame is attained
And leave disasters upon oneself
Wealth and position bring arrogance
No one is able to protect them
Gold and jade fill up the room
Cannot be kept for long
Pounding a blade and sharpening it
Cannot be as good as stopping short
Holding a cup and overfilling it
It is therefore beyond reproach
Because it does not contend
Moving with great timing
Handling with great capability
Governing with great administration
Speaking with great integrity
Giving with great kindness
Feeling with great depth
Dwelling with the right location
Therefore it is similar to the Tao
It stays in places that people dislike
Water greatly benefits myriad things without contention
The highest goodness resembles water
That is how they can achieve their own goals
Is it not due to their selflessness?
Are outside of themselves and yet survive
Place themselves last but end up in front
Therefore the sages:
Thus they can last forever
Is that they do not exist for themselves
The reason Heaven and Earth can last forever
Heaven and Earth are everlasting
Utilize it; it is never exhausted
It flows continuously, barely perceptible
Is called the root of Heaven and Earth
The gate of the Mystic Female
Is called the Mystic Female
The valley spirit, undying
Cannot compare to keeping to the void
Too many words hasten failure
It moves, and produces more
Empty, and yet never exhausted
Is it not like a bellows?
The space between Heaven and Earth
They regard people as straw dogs
The sages are impartial
They regard myriad things as straw dogs
Heaven and Earth are impartial
Its image is the predecessor of the Emperor
I do not know whose offspring it is
So indistinct! It seems to exist
Mixes the dusts
Dims the glare
Unravels the knots
It blunts the sharpness
So deep! It seems to be the source of all things
The Tao is empty; when utilized, it is not filled up
And nothing will be beyond control
Act without contrivance
So those who scheme will not dare to meddle
Let the people have no cunning and no greed
Strengthens their bones
Weakens their ambitions
Fills their bellies
Empties their hearts
Thus the governance of the sage:
So their hearts will not be confused
Do not show the desired things
So the people will not become thieves
Do not treasure goods that are hard to obtain
So the people will not squabble
Do not glorify the achievers
That it never goes away
It is because they do not dwell on success
They succeed but do not dwell on success
They act but do not presume
They create but do not possess
They work with myriad things but do not control
Conduct the teaching of no words
Manage the work of detached actions
Therefore the sages:
Front and back follow each other
Music and voice harmonize each other
High and low support each other
Long and short reveal each other
Difficult and easy bring about each other
Thus being and non-being produce each other
When it knows good as good, evil arises
When the world knows beauty as beauty, ugliness arises
Mystery of mysteries, the door to all wonders
The unity is said to be the mystery
These two emerge together but differ in name
Constantly with desire, one observes its manifestations
Thus, constantly without desire, one observes its essence
The named is the mother of myriad things
The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth
The name that can be named is not the eternal name
The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao
